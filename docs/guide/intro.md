# Introduction

A ChatUI that supports plugins and prioritizes local processing. I like PoeAI, but dislike the subscription model. After using the API, my monthly AI bill decreased by more than 10 times ($20 => $1.43).

- Local first
- Plugin support
- Simple self-hosting
- Cross-platform web support
- Open Source & Privacy

## Thanks

Among all current ChatUIs, I like PoeAI the most for functionality and HF ChatUI the most for UI design. Since the latter is open-source, I directly copied many components and code from it.
